Force-Directed World Layout
===========================

Based on [this cool demo](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1073373) of a d3 Force layout for the 48 Contiguous States, I thought it would be a cool to see the same thing but with the whole world. 

The map originally used the Mercator projection, but I found the Equirectangular layout worked a bit better in terms of space.
